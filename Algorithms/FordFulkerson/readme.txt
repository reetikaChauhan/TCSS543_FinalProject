Psuedo Code:
'''
 Max-Flow(FordFulkerson)
 Initially f(e)=0 for all e in G
 While there is an s-t path in the residual graph Gf
 Let P be a simple s-t path in Gf
 f =augment(f, P)
 Update f to be f'
 Update the residual graph Gf to be Gf'
 Endwhile
 Return f
 '''
'''
augment(f, P)
 Let b=bottleneck(P, f)
 For each edge (u,v)∈P
   If e=(u,v) is a forward edge then
     increase f(e) in G by b
   Else ((u, v) is a backward edge, and let e=(v,u))
     decrease f(e) in G by b
 Endif
 Endfor
 Return(f)

Input: A graph in form of adjacency dictionaries that is generated by  Graphinjest.py file.
The format: graph[u][v] = capacity

Output:  Maximum flow from source(s) to sink(t) node and no. of s-t paths generated while building residual graphs.
Also the code calculates and keep track of start time, end time and memory used.

Implementation: The code leverages DFS algorithm to find augumented paths which is the function augmentedPath. The code maintains residual graph by forward edges track remaining available capacity
backward edges allow undoing flow if needed.

The augmentedPath function: 
Input: Residul graph, source("s") and sink ("t") node.
Output: s-t Path and flow(bottleneck)

Time complexity:
Let:

V = number of vertices

E = number of edges

F = total maximum flow value

Worst-case time complexity of Ford–Fulkerson: O(E*F)
