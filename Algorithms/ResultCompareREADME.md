# ResultCompare.py — Runtime Analysis & Visualization Module

## Overview

`ResultCompare.py` analyzes and visualizes the performance of all three implemented max-flow algorithms:

- **Ford–Fulkerson (FF)**
- **Scaling Ford–Fulkerson (SFF)**
- **Preflow–Push (PF)**

The script loads the CSV files generated by each automated algorithm run, merges them into a unified dataset, computes statistical summaries, and produces a complete set of performance visualizations.

These results help evaluate how each algorithm scales across graph families, graph sizes, and capacity ranges.

---

## Prerequisites — Generate CSV Files First

Before running `ResultCompare.py`, you must generate the performance CSV files by executing each algorithm’s automated batch script.

### 1. Run Ford–Fulkerson Batch Script

```bash
python Algorithms/FordFulkerson/automated_fordfulkerson.py
```
This generates FordFulkerson/results_fordfulkerson_generated.csv

### 2. Run Scaling Ford–Fulkerson Batch Script
```bash
python Algorithms/ScalingFordFulkerson/automated_scalingFordFukerson.py
```
This generates ScalingFordFulkerson/results_scaling_ff_generated.csv

### 3. Run Preflow–Push Batch Script
```bash
python Algorithms/PreflowPush/automated_preflowpush.py
``` 
This generates PreflowPush/results_preflowpush_generated.csv

### Required Folder Structure

Algorithms/
│
├── FordFulkerson/
│   └── results_fordfulkerson_generated.csv
│
├── ScalingFordFulkerson/
│   └── results_scaling_ff_generated.csv
│
├── PreflowPush/
│   └── results_preflowpush_generated.csv
│
└── ResultCompare.py

### How to Run ResultCompare.py

```bash
cd TCSS543_FinalProject
python Algorithms/ResultCompare.py
``` 
No arguments are required.
The script automatically:

Loads the CSVs

Merges all performance results

Prints summary statistics

Generates visualizations

Saves all figures as PNGs

## Outputs Generated

### Statistical Summaries Printed to Console

- Overall runtime statistics

- Runtime by graph type

- Time-per-edge averages

- Speedup factors:
-   PF vs FF
-   PF vs SFF
-   SFF vs FF

### Visualization Outputs (PNG Files)

- Runtime distribution boxplots (log scale)
- Mean runtime by graph type
- Runtime vs. number of edges
- Speedup factor bar charts
- Win-count bar chart
- Time-per-edge comparison
- Augmenting paths vs. runtime (FF & SFF)
- Per-graph-type runtime boxplots
- Winner mosaic heatmap
- Donut chart of algorithm win percentages

All images are saved in the working directory.
